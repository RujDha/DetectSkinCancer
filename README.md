## General Information
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

Multiclass classification model creation using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.

## Conclusions
- Data augmentation helped to make generalized model and address overfitting problem
- Class rebalancing improved accuracy from ~50% to ~80% for training as well as validation dataset

## Technologies Used
- Google Colab <General Subscription using TPU Runtime type>
- Git - version 2.37.3.windows.1
- GitHub version 2.37.3
